==JSON Reader

* Use FSRGen to generate the FSRGen
* Read JSON-B / JSON-D data
* Implement XML and ASN.1 encoders.

==DNS

This is currently a stub - and a really bad one. Separate this out
into a library Goedel.DNS that does the job properly. This can then be the 
basis for a Private DNS class.
