# ToDo

## Clear the unit tests

These are failing due to the upgrades.

## New Activation scheme. 

Activations are simply a list of name-keydata pairs. each pair activates a specific key.

Can add an activation to the CatalogApplication as a Right. 

Activations to a device appear in the CatalogDevice.


## Detached client/server

Can be run from the console.

Provide simple service + restart capability


### Issue of connection PIN codes.

Service admin tool generates PIN codes and adds them to the service log. Hmm... seems this is a user thang???
