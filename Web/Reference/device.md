The `device auth` command changes the set of authorizations given to the
specified device, adding or removing authorizations according to the 
flags specified on the command line.

The parameter specifies the device being configured by means of either
the UDF of the device profile or the device identifier.

The `/id` option may be used to specify a friendly name for the device.

Specifying the `/all` option causes the device to be granted all the 
available device authorizations except for those explicitly denied 
by means of a negative authorization grant (e.g. `/nobookmark`).

Specifying the `/noall` option causes the device to be granted no 
available device authorizations except for those explicitly granted 
by means of a positive authorization grant (e.g. `/bookmark`).

If neither the `/all` option or the `/noall` option is specified, the 
device authorizations remain unchanged except where explicitly 
granted or denied.

The following authorizations may be granted or denied:

* `bookmark`: Authorize response to confirmation requests
* `calendar`: Authorize access to calendar catalog
* `contact`: Authorize access to contacts catalog
* `confirm`: Authorize response to confirmation requests
* `mail`: Authorize access to configure SMTP mail services.
* `network`: Authorize access to the network catalog
* `password`: Authorize access to password catalog
* `ssh`: Authorize use of SSH
