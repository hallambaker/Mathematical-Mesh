# Using the  Command Set

The  command set contains commands that 

## Adding passwords

Having created her application service account, Alice can add a credential. In this
case it is the username and password for an ftp service:


````
>password 
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````

## Finding passwords

Having added the password to her profile, Alice can retrieve it when needed.


````
>password 
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````

She can also list all the passwords in her catalog:


````
>password 
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````

Using the password catalog in this fashion provides a reminder. But what Alice really
wants to be able to do is to automate the process of using the ftp client to upload 
files without having to enter her password each time or (worse) include the password
in the script:


## Updating passwords

Having automated access to the ftp site, Alice doesn't need her password to be either
memorable or conveniently short. She decides to replace her bad password with a strong
password that is randomly generated:


````
>password 
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````


## Deleting passwords

Password entries may be deleted using the 


````
>password 
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````


## Adding a Device.

When a device is added, all the passwords are copied


````
>password list
ERROR - The command  is not known.
````
