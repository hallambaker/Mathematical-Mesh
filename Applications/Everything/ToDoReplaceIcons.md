# Icons for Everything

The icons in this folder are mostly from the free icons created by Font Awesome.

https://fontawesome.com/

We do have a license to use the paid icons and it is very likely these will be used
in the binary distribution of future releases. But these can't be uploaded to 
the public github of course.


## Replacing placeholder icons

Some, (many) of the icons are placeholders. To replace a placeholder with something
better, create an SVG of the proposed replacement and save it in the folder under the
name of the icon you want to replace.

Applications/Everything/Resources/Images

So to replace the SSH icon with something that says SSH, create an SVG and save it 
under application_ssh

## Icons needing replacement

application_ssh			SSH in text
application_pkix		Certificate
application_developer	???

platform_ios			mobile with iOS on the screen?
platform_macos			iMac ?
