#Key Exchange Service

Supports key exchange to establish a shared secret and bound ticket
between a client and a service

<dt>SRV Prefix: _jwcexchange._tcp

<dt>HTTP Well Known Service Prefix: /.well-known/jwcexchange



Every Recrypt Service transaction consists of exactly one
request followed by exactly one response.

##Shared classes

###Structure: Algorithms

Describes an algorithm suite. Each suite consists of sets of authentication and
encryption algorithms which are mutually compatible. i.e. the counterparty MAY
select any one of the encryption algorithms and use it with any one of the 
authentication algorithms.

<dl>
<dt>Encryption: String [0..Many]
<dd>Algorithm identifiers of encryption and authenticated encryption algorithms offered
<dt>Authentication: String [0..Many]
<dd>Authentication algorithm offer
</dl>
##Utility Transactions

##Transaction: Exchange

<dl>
<dt>Request:  ExchangeRequest
<dt>Response:  ExchangeResponse
</dl>

Perform Key Exchange to establish shared key bound to a ticket. 

###Message: ExchangeRequest

Initiate the key exchange request.

<dl>
<dt>Offer: Algorithms [0..Many]
<dd>Set of message authentication and encryption algorithms offered by the client
</dl>
###Message: ExchangeResponse

Returns the server parameters.

<dl>
<dt>Ticket: Binary (Optional)
<dd>Opaque session identifier.
<dt>Witness: Binary (Optional)
<dd>Opaque witness value used to prove binding to the ticket.
<dt>Encryption: String [0..Many]
<dd>Algorithm identifiers of encryption or authenticated encryption algorithm chosen
<dt>Authentication: String [0..Many]
<dd>Algorithm identifiers of authentication algorithm chosen
</dl>
