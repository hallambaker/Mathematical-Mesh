Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and
   credential data between multiple user devices. The core protocols of
   the Mesh are described with examples of common use cases and
   reference data.

   This document has two main sections. The first section presents
   examples of the Mesh assertions, catalog entry and messages in use.
   The second section contains the schema reference. All the material in
   both sections is generated from the Mesh reference implementation .

   Although some of the services described in this document could be
   used to replace existing Internet protocols including FTP and SMTP,
   the principal value of any communication protocol lies in the size of
   the audience it allows them to communicate with. Thus, while the Mesh
   Messaging service is designed to support efficient and reliable
   transfer of messages ranging in size from a few bytes to multiple
   terabytes, the near-term applications of these services will be to
   applications that are not adequately supported by existing protocols
   if at all.

3. Actors

   The Mesh mediates interactions between three principal actors:
   Accounts, Devices, and Services.

   Currently two account types are specified, user accounts which belong
   to an individual user and group accounts that are used to share
   access to confidential information between a group of users. It may
   prove useful to define new types of account over time or to eliminate
   the distinction entirely. When active a Mesh account is bound to a
   Mesh Service. The service to which an account is bound MAY be changed
   over time but an account can only be bound to a single service at a
   time.

   A Mesh account is an abstract construct that (when active) is
   instantiated across one or more physical machines called a device.
   Each device that is connected to an account has a separate set of
   cryptographic keys that are used to interact with other devices
   connected to the account and MAY be provisioned with access to the
   account private keys which MAY or MAY NOT be mediated by the current
   Mesh Service.

   A Mesh Service is an abstract construct that is provided by one or
   more physical machines called Hosts. A Mesh Host is a device that is
   attached to a service rather than an account.

3.1. Accounts

   A Mesh Account is described by a Profile descended from Profile
   Account and contains a set of Mesh stores. Currently two account
   profiles are defined:

         ProfileUser

         ProfileGroup

   Both types of profile specify the following fields:

         ProfileSignature

         AccountAddress

         ServiceUdf

         AdministratorSignature

         AccountEncryption

   User accounts specify two additional public keys, AccountSignature
   and AccountAuthentication which allow signature and authentication
   operations under the account context.

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021


   Every account contains a set of catalogs and spools that are managed
   by the service as directed by the contents of the associated Access
   catalog.

   For example, the personal account profile Alice created is:

   {

3.2. Device

   Every Mesh device has a set of private keys that are unique to that
   device. These keys MAY be installed during manufacture, installed
   from an external source after manufacture or generated on the device.
   If the platform capabilities allow, device private keys SHOULD be
   bound to the device so that they cannot be extracted or exported
   without substantial effort.

   The public keys corresponding to the device private keys are
   specified in a ProfileDevice. This MUST contain at least the
   following fields:

         ProfileSignature

         BaseEncryption

         BaseAuthentication

         BaseSignature

   For example, the device profile corresponding to Alice's coffee pot
   device is:

3.2.1. Activation

   The device private keys are only used to perform cryptographic
   operations during the process of connecting a device to an account.
   During that connection process, a threshold key generation scheme is
   used to generate a second set of device keys bound to the account by
   combining the base key held by the device with a second device
   private key provided by the administration device approving the
   connection of the device to the account. The resulting key is
   referred to as the device key. The process of combining the base keys
   with the contributions to form the device keys is called Activation.

   The activation record for Alice's coffee pot device is:

   The Mesh protocols are designed so that there is never a need to
   export or escrow private keys of any type associated with a device,
   neither the base key, nor the device key nor the contribution from
   the administration device.

   This approach to device configuration ensures that the keys that are
   used by the device when operating within the context of the account
   are entirely separate from those originally provided by the device
   manufacturer or generated on the device, provided only that the key
   contributions from the administration device are sufficiently random
   and unguessable.

   The public keys corresponding to the composite keys generated during
   the connection process are described in a ConnectionUser assertion
   signed by the administration key of the corresponding account.

   The connection record for Alice's coffee pot device is:

   The ConnectionUser assertion MAY be used in the same fashion as an
   X.509v3/PKIX certificate to mediate interactions between devices
   connected to the same account without the need for interaction with
   the Mesh service. Thus, a coffee pot device connected to the account
   can receive and authenticate instructions issued by a voice
   recognition device connected to that account.

   While the ConnectionUser assertion MAY be used to mediate external
   interactions, this approach is typically undesirable as it provides
   the external parties with visibility to the internal configuration of
   the account, in particular which connected devices are being used on
   which occasions. Furthermore, the lack of the need to interact with
   the service means that the service is necessarily unable to mediate
   the exchange and enforce authorization policy on the interactions.

   Device keys are intended to be used to secure communications between
   devices connected to the same account. All communication between Mesh
   accounts SHOULD be mediated by a Mesh service. This enables abuse
   mitigation by applying access control to every outbound and every
   inbound message.

   Since Alice's coffee pot does not require the external communication
   right, the activation record for the coffee pot does not provide
   access to the account keys required to perform external
   communications. Alice's watch device does require access to the
   account keys so it can receive messages and task updates. But since
   it is a device that Alice has to carry on her person to use, it is a
   device that might easily be lost or stolen. Accordingly, the
   activation record for Alice's watch provides access to the account
   decryption and signature keys but in the form of threshold key shares
   mediated by the Mesh service. Thus, Alice's watch can sign and read
   message sent to the account but only under the control of the Mesh
   service.

3.3. Service

   Mesh services are described by a ProfileService. This specifies the
   encryption, and signature authentication keys used to interact with
   the abstract service.

   Since Mesh accounts and services are both abstract constructs, they
   cannot interact directly. A device connected to an account can only
   interact with a service by interacted with a device authorized to
   provide services on behalf of one or more accounts connected to the
   service. Such a device is called a Mesh Host.

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021


   Mesh hosts MAY be managed using the same ProfileDevice and device
   connection mechanism provided for management of user devices or by
   whatever other management protocols prove convenient. The only part
   of the Service/Host interaction that is visible to devices connected
   to a profile and to hosts connected to other services is the
   ConnectionHost structure that describes the set of device keys to use
   in interactions with that specific host.

4. Catalogs

   Catalogs track sets of persistent objects associated with a Mesh
   Service Account. The Mesh Service has no access to the entries in any
   Mesh catalog except for the Device and Contacts catalog which are
   used in device authentication and authorization of inbound messages.

   Each Mesh Catalog managed by a Mesh Account has a name of the form:

   <prefix>_<name>

   Where <prefix> is the IANA assigned service name. The assigned
   service name for the Mathematical Mesh is mmm. Thus, all catalogs
   specified by the Mesh schema have names prefixed with the sequence
   mmm_.

   The following catalogs are currently specified within the
   Mathematical Mesh.

         Access: mmm_Access

         Application: mmm_Application

         Bookmark: mmm_Bookmark

         Contact: mmm_Contact

         Credential: mmm_Credential

         Device: mmm_Device

         Network: mmm_Network

         Member: mmm_Member

         Publication: mmm_Publication

         Task: mmm_CatalogTask

   The Access, Publication, Device and Member catalogs are involved in
   Mesh Service Protocol interactions. These interactions are further
   described in the Protocol Reference  .

   In many cases, the Mesh Catalog offers capabilities that represent a
   superset of the capabilities of an existing application. For example,
   the task catalog supports the appointment tracking functions of a
   traditional calendar application and the task tracking function of
   the traditional 'to do list' application. Combining these functions
   allows tasks to be triggered by other events other than the passage
   of time such as completion of other tasks, geographical presence,
   etc.

   In such cases, the Mesh Catalog entries are designed to provide a
   superset of the data representation capabilities of the legacy
   formats and (where available) recent extensions. Where a catalog
   entry is derived from input presented in a legacy format, the
   original data representation MAY be attached verbatim to facilitate
   interoperability.

4.1. Access

   The access catalog mmm_Access contains a list of access control
   entries granting a party authenticated using a particular
   cryptographic credential a specific privilege such as:

         *  Accept Mesh Messages of particular types

         *  Perform an operation on a private key known to the service.

   As with the publication catalog, the access catalog provides
   information that is necessary for the Mesh Service to act on behalf
   of the user. It is therefore necessary to grant a decryption
   capability for this catalog during the process of binding the account
   to a service.

4.2. Application

   The application catalog mmm_Application contains
   CatalogEntryApplication entries which describe the use of specific
   applications under the Mesh Service Account. Multiple application
   accounts for a single application MAY be connected to a single Mesh
   Service Account. Each account being specified in a separate entry.

   The CatalogEntryApplication entries only contain configuration
   information for the application as it applies to the account as a
   whole. If the application requires separate configuration for
   individual devices, this is specified in separate activation records
   specified in the corresponding ConnectionDevice.

4.2.1. Mesh Account

   Mesh Accounts are described by CatalogEntryAccount entries. The
   corresponding activation records for the connected devices contain
   the contributions used to derive the private keys for use of the
   account.

   The CatalogEntryAccount entry is described in the section describing
   Mesh accounts above.

4.2.2. SSH

   SSH configuration profiles are described by
   CatalogEntryApplicationSSH entries. The corresponding activation
   records for the connected devices contain the contributions used to
   derive the private keys.

   A user may have separate SSH configurations for separate purposes
   within a single Mesh Account. This allows a system administrator
   servicing multiple clients to maintain separate SSH profiles for each
   of her customers allowing credentials to be easily (and verifiably)
   revoked at contract termination.

   The SSH profile contains the information that is stored in the
   known_hosts and authorized_keys files of SSH clients and servers.

4.2.3. Mail

   Mail configuration profiles are described by one or more
   CatalogEntryApplicationMail entries, one for each email account
   connected to the Mesh profile. The corresponding activation records
   for the connected devices contain information used to provide the
   device with the necessary decryption information.

   Entries specify the email account address(es), the inbound and
   outbound server configuration and the cryptographic keys to be used
   for S/MIME and OpenPGP encryption.

4.3. Bookmark

   The bookmark catalog mmm_bookmark contains CatalogEntryBookmark
   entries which describe Web bookmarks and other citations allowing
   them to be shared between devices connected to the profile.

   The fields currently supported by the Bookmarks catalog are currently
   limited to the fields required for tracking Web bookmarks.
   Specification of additional fields to track full academic citations
   is a work in progress.

   The fields of the contact catalog provide a superset of the
   capabilities of vCard .

   The Contact catalog is typically used by the MeshService as a source
   of authorization information to perform access control on inbound and
   outbound message requests. For this reason, Mesh Service SHOULD be
   granted read access to the contacts catalog by providing a decryption
   entry for the service.

4.5. Credential

   The credential catalog mmm_credential contains CatalogEntryCredential
   entries which describe credentials used to access network resources.

   {
     "CatalogedCredential":{
       "Service":"ftp.example.com",
       "Username":"alice1",
       "Password":"password"}}

   Only username/password credentials are stored in the credential
   catalog. If public key credentials are to be used, these SHOULD be
   managed as an application profile allowing separate credentials to be
   created for each device.

4.6. Device

   The device catalog mmm_Device contains CatalogEntryDevice entries
   which describe the devices connected to the account and the
   permissions assigned to them.

   Each device connected to a Mesh Account has an associated
   CatalogEntryDevice entry that includes the activation and connection
   records for the account. These records are described in further
   detail in section  REF _Ref54628559 \r \h 0.

4.7. Network

   The network catalog contains CatalogEntryNetwork entries which
   describe network settings, IPSEC and TLS VPN configurations, etc.

   The publication catalog mmm_Publication contains
   CatalogEntryPublication entries which describe content published
   through the account.

4.9. Task

   The Task catalog mmm_Task contains CatalogEntryTask entries which
   describe tasks assigned to the user including calendar entries and to
   do lists.

   The fields of the task catalog currently reflect those offered by the
   iCalendar specification . Specification of additional fields to allow
   task triggering on geographic location and/or completion of other
   tasks is a work in progress.

5. Spools

   Spools are DARE Containers containing an append only list of messages
   sent or received by an account. Three spools are currently defined:

         Inbound

         Outbound

         Local

   Every Mesh Message has a unique message identifier. Messages created
   at the beginning of a new messaging protocol interaction are assigned
   a random message identifier. Responses to previous messages are
   assigned message identifiers formed from the message identifier to
   which they respond by means of a message digest function.

   Every Mesh Message stored in a spool is encapsulated in an envelope
   which bears a unique identifier that is formed by applying a message
   digest function to the message identifier. Each stored message has an
   associated state which is initially set to the state Initial and MAY
   be subsequently altered by one or more MessageComplete messages
   subsequently appended to the spool. The allowable message states
   depending upon the spool in question.

5.1. Outbound

   The outbound spool stores messages that are to be or have been sent
   and MessageComplete messages reporting changes to the status of the
   messages stored on the spool.

   Messages posted to the outbound spool have the state Initial, Sent,
   Received or Refused:

         Initial

         Sent

         Received

         Refused

   MessageComplete messages are only valid when posted to the spool by
   the service.

5.2. Inbound

   The inbound spool stores messages that have been received by the Mesh
   service servicing the account and MessageComplete messages reporting
   changes to the status of the messages stored on the spool.

   Messages posted to the outbound spool have the state Initial, Read:

         Initial

         Read

   A message previously marked as read MAY be returned to the unread
   state by marking it as being in the Initial state.

5.3. Local

   The local spool stores messages that are used for administrative
   functions. In normal circumstances, only administrator devices and
   the Mesh Service require access to the local spool.

   The local spool is used to store MessagePin messages used to notify
   administration devices that a PIN code has been registered for some
   purpose and RespondConnection messages used to inform a device of the
   result of a connection request.

   The local spool is used in a device connection operation to provide a
   device with the activation and connection records required to access
   the service as an authorized client. Servicing these requests
   requires that the service be able to access messages stored in the

   Messages posted to the outbound spool have the states Initial,
   Closed:

         Initial

         Closed

6. Cryptographic Operations

   The Mesh makes use of various cryptographic operations including
   threshold operations. For convenience, these are gathered here and
   specified as functions that are referenced by other parts of the
   specification.

6.1. Key Derivation from Seed

   Mesh Keys that derived from a seed value use the mechanism described
   in . Use of the keyname parameter allows multiple keys for different
   uses to be derived from a single key. Thus escrow of a single seed
   value permits recovery of all the private keys associated with the
   profile.

   The keyname parameter is a string formed by concatenating identifiers
   specifying the key type, the actor that will use the key and the key
   operation:

6.2. Message Envelope and Response Identifiers.

   Every Mesh message has a unique Message Identifier MessageId. The
   MakeID() function is used to calculate the value of Envelope
   Identifier and Response identifier from the message identifier as
   follows:

   static string MakeID(string udf, string content) {
       var (code, bds) = UDF.Parse(udf);
       return code switch
           {
               UdfTypeIdentifier.Digest_SHA_3_512 => 
                   UDF.ContentDigestOfDataString(
                   bds, content, cryptoAlgorithmId: 
                       CryptoAlgorithmId.SHA_3_512),
               _ => UDF.ContentDigestOfDataString(
               bds, content, cryptoAlgorithmId: 
                       CryptoAlgorithmId.SHA_2_512),
               };

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021


   Where the values of content are given as follows:

   String String

   For example:

   MessageID 
       = NBF4-4PTH-UTSC-RYHZ-EQMK-BVH7-MU3F
   
   EnvelopeID 
       = MD22-62AQ-PVVT-NPUS-ATUC-MQH4-PWV2
   
   ResponseID 
       = MCZ5-YD47-KD23-MHLY-F34Z-PFVI-47VK

6.3. Proof of Knowledge of PIN

   Mesh Message classes that are subclasses of MessagePinValidated MAY
   be authenticated by means of a PIN. Currently two such messages are
   defined: MessageContact used in contact exchange and
   RequestConnection message used in device connection.

   The PIN codes used to authenticate MessagePinValidated messages are
   UDF Authenticator strings. The type code of the identifier specifies
   the algorithm to be used to authenticate the PIN code and the Binary
   Data Sequence value specifies the key.

   The inputs to the PIN proof of knowledge functions are:

         PIN: string

         Action: string

         Account: string

         ClientNonce: binary

         PayloadDigest: binary

   The following values of Action are currently defined:

   String String

   These inputs are used to derive values as follows:

   alg =           UdfAlg (PIN)
   pinData =       UdfBDS (PIN)
   saltedPINData = MAC (Action, pinData)
   saltedPIN =     UDFPresent (HMAC_SHA_2_512 + saltedPINData)
   PinId =         UDFPresent (MAC (Account, saltedPINData))

   The issuer of the PIN code stores the value saltedPIN for retrieval
   using the  key PinId.

   The witness value for a Dare Envelope with payload digest
   PayloadDigest  authenticated by a PIN code whose salted value is
   saltedPINData, issued  by account Account is given by PinWitness() as
   follows:

   witnessData =   Account.ToUTF8() + ClientNonce + PayloadDigest
   witnessValue =  MAC (witnessData , saltedPINData)

   For example, to generate saltedPIN for the pin AAJP-KPYV-NSB4-GIYL-AM
   used to authenticate a an action of type Device:

   pin = AAJP-KPYV-NSB4-GIYL-AM
   action = message.
   
   alg = UdfAlg (PIN)
       = Authenticator_HMAC_SHA_2_512
   
   hashalg = default (alg, HMAC_SHA_2_512)
   
   pinData = UdfBDS (PIN)
       = System.Byte[]
   
   saltedPINData 
       = hashalg(pinData, hashalg);

       = ADBB-JTKR-RGGL-ACEM-TW6E-ZFY6-NQXF

   The PinId binding the pin to the account alice@example.com is

   Account =  alice@example.com 
   
   PinId = UDFPresent (MAC (Account, saltedPINData))
       = ADVR-47UA-ZHDX-6CFS-GDDD-RYTA-LSB6

   Where MAC(data, key) is the message authentication code algorithm
   specified by the value of alg.

   When an administrative device issues a PIN code, a Message PIN is
   appended to the local spool. This has the MessageId PinId and
   specifies the value saltedPIN in the field of that name.

   When PIN code authentication is used, a message of type
   MessagePinValidated specifies the values ClientNonce, PinWitness and
   PinId in the fields of those names. These values are used to
   authenticate the inner message data specified by the
   AuthenticatedData field.

6.4. EARL

   The UDF Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locator mechanism is used to
   publish data and provide means of authentication and access through a
   static identifier such as a QR code.

   This mechanism is used to allow contact exchange by means of a QR
   code printed on a business card and to connect a device to an account
   using a static identifier printed on the device in the form of a QR
   code.

   In both cases, the information is passed using the EARL format
   described in  .

6.5. Key Agreement

   All Mesh Protocol requests except for the HelloRequest and every
   response MUST be authenticated under the device key of the host or
   device making the request.

   Initial authentication is achieved by performing a Key agreement
   under the DeviceAuthentication key of each of the hosts and combining
   the result with nonce values provided by the requestor and respondent
   using a KDF function as follows:

   Two bindings are currently planned.

         DARE Envelope over HTTPS

         UDP Transport

   Once authentication has been performed, the same pair of devices MAY
   re-authenticate using the previously agreed key. To facilitate
   stateless implementation, a host specifies an opaque identifier to be
   used to identify the shared secret on subsequent uses which MAY be
   used to recover the shared secret from the opaque identifier.

   [To be specified]

6.6. Service Cryptographic Operations

   A Mesh Service acts as the counterparty for threshold operations
   allowing mitigation of the risk of compromise of an individual device
   connected to a user account or an insider threat from an individual
   member of a group account.

   When acting in this role, the Mesh service controls the use of the
   cryptographic function but does not have the ability to perform the
   action either by itself or by collaborating with other services to
   which the account has been bound in the past.

   Note that this approach limits rather than eliminates trust in the
   service. As with services presenting themselves as 'zero trust', a
   Mesh service becomes a trusted service after a sufficient number of
   breaches in other parts of the system have occurred. And the user
   trusts the service to provide availability of the service.

   Three service cryptographic operations are currently specified:

         Threshold Key Share

         Threshold Key Agreement

         Threshold Signature

   The implementation of the cryptographic operations described above is
   described in  and .

7. Mesh Assertions

   Mesh Assertions are signed DARE Envelopes that contain one of more
   claims. Mesh Assertions provide the basis for trust in the
   Mathematical Mesh.






Hallam-Baker            Expires February 6, 2022               [Page 25]

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021

   Mesh Assertions are divided into two classes. Mesh Profiles are self-
   signed assertions. Assertions that are not self-signed are called
   declarations. The only type of declaration currently defined is a
   Connection Declaration describing the connection of a device to an
   account.

7.1. Encoding

   The payload of a Mesh Assertion is a JSON encoded object that is a
   subclass of the Assertion class which defines the following fields:

         Identifier

         Updated

         NotaryToken

         Conditions

   The implementation of the NotaryToken and Conditions mechanisms is to
   be specified in  at a future date.

   Note that the implementation of Conditions differs significantly from
   that of SAML. Relying parties are required to process condition
   clauses in a SAML assertion to determine validity. Mesh Relying
   parties MAY verify the conditions clauses or rely on the
   trustworthiness of the provider.

   The reason for weakening the processing of conditions clauses in the
   Mesh is that it is only ever possible to validate a conditions clause
   of any type relative to a ground truth. In SAML applications, the
   relying party almost invariably has access to an independent source
   of ground truth. A Mesh device connected to a Mesh Service does not.
   Thus the types of verification that can be achieved in practice are
   limited to verifying the consistency of current and previous
   statements from the Mesh Service.

7.2. Mesh Profiles

   Mesh Profiles perform a similar role to X.509v3 certificates but with
   important differences:

         *  Profiles describe credentials, they do not make identity
            statements

         *  Profiles do not expire, there is therefore no need to
            support renewal processing.

         *  Profiles may be modified over time, the current and past
            status of a profile being recorded in an append only log.




Hallam-Baker            Expires February 6, 2022               [Page 26]

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021

   Profiles provide the axioms of trust for the Mesh PKI. Unlike in the
   PKIX model in which all trust flows from axioms of trust held by a
   small number of Certificate Authorities, every part in the Mesh
   contributes their own axiom of trust.

   It should be noted however that the role of Certificate Authorities
   is redefined rather than eliminated. Rather than making assertions
   whose subject is represented by identities which are inherently
   mutable and subjective, Certificate Authorities can now make
   assertions about immutable cryptographic keys.

   Every Profile MUST contain a SignatureKey field and MUST be signed by
   the key specified in that field.

   A Profile is valid if and only if:

         *  There is a SignatureKey field.

         *  The profile is signed under the key specified in the
            SignatureKey field.

   A profile has the status current if and only if:

         *  The Profile is valid

         *  Every Conditions clause in the profile is understood by the
            relying party and evaluates to true.

7.3. Mesh Connections

   A Mesh connection is an assertion describing the connection of a
   device or a member to an account.

   Mesh connections provide similar functionality to 'end-entity'
   certificates in PKIX but with the important proviso that they are
   only used to provide trust between a device connected to an account
   and the service to which that account is bound and between the
   devices connected to an account.

   A connection is valid with respect to an account with profile P if
   and only if:

         *  The profile P is valid

         *  The AuthorityUdf field of the connection is consistent with
            the UDF of P

         *  The profile is signed under the key specified in the
            AdministrationKey field of P.

         *  Any conditions specified in the profile are met

   A connection has the status current with respect to an account with
   profile if and only if:

         *  The connection is valid with respect to the account with
            profile P.

         *  The profile P is current.

   A device is authenticated with respect to an account with profile P
   if and only if:

         *  The connection is valid with respect to the account with
            profile P.

         *  The device has presented an appropriate proof of knowledge
            of the DeviceAuthentication key specified in the connection.

8. Architecture

   The Mesh architecture has four principal components:

         Mesh Account

         Mesh Device Management

         Mesh Service

         Mesh Messaging

   The separation of accounts and services as separate components is a
   key distinction between the Mesh and earlier Internet applications. A
   Mesh account belongs to the owner of the Mesh and not the Mesh
   Service Provider which the user may change at any time of their
   choosing.

   A Mesh Account May be active or inactive. By definition, an active
   Mesh account is serviced by exactly one Mesh Service, an inactive
   Mesh account is not serviced by a Mesh Service. A Mesh Service
   Provider MAY offer a backup service for accounts hosted by other
   providers. In this case the backup provider is connected to the
   account as a Mesh device, thus allowing the backup provider to
   maintain a copy of the stores contained in the account and
   facilitating a rapid transfer of responsibility for servicing the
   account should that be desired. The use of backup providers is
   described further in .

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021

8.1. Mesh Account

   Mesh Accounts contains all the stateful information (contacts,
   calendar entries, inbound and outbound messages, etc.) related to a
   particular persona used by the owner.

   By definition a Mesh Account is active if it is serviced by a Mesh
   Service and inactive otherwise. A Mesh user MAY change their service
   provider at any time. An active Mesh Account is serviced by exactly
   one Mesh Service at once but a user MAY register a 'backup' service
   provider to their account in the same manner as adding an advice.
   This ensures that the backup service is pre-populated with all the
   information required to allow the user to switch to the new provider
   without interruption of service.

   Each Mesh account is described by an Account Profile. Currently
   separate profile Account Profile are defined for user accounts and
   group accounts. It is not clear if this distinction is a useful one.

8.1.1. Account Profile

   A Mesh account profile provides the axiom of trust for a mesh user.
   It contains a Master Signature Key and one or more Administration
   Signature Keys. The unique identifier of the master profile is the
   UDF of the Master Signature Key.

   An Account Profile MUST specify an EscrowEncryption key. This key MAY
   be used to escrow private keys used for encryption of stored data.
   They SHOULD NOT be used to escrow authentication keys and MUST NOT be
   used to escrow signature keys.

   A user should not need to replace their account profile unless they
   intend to establish a separate identity. To minimize the risk of
   disclosure, the Profile Signature Key is only ever used to sign
   updates to the account profile itself. This allows the user to secure
   their Profile Signature Key by either keeping it on hardware token or
   device dedicated to that purpose or by using the escrow mechanism and
   paper recovery keys as described in this document.

8.1.1.1. Creating a ProfileMaster

   Creating a ProfileMaster comprises the steps of:

         0) Creating a Master Signature key.

         0) Creating an Online Signing Key

         0) Persisting the ProfileMaster on the administration device to
            the CatalogHost.

         0) (Optional) Connecting at least one Administration Device and
            granting it the ActivationAdministration activation.

8.1.1.2. Updating a ProfileMaster

   Updating a ProfileMaster comprises the steps of:

         0) Making the necessary changes.

         0) Signing the ProfileMaster using the Master Signature Key

         0) Persisting the ProfileMaster on the administration device to
            the CatalogHost.

8.2. Device Management

   Device management allows a collection of devices belonging to a user
   to function as a single personal Mesh.

   The device management functions are principally concerned with the
   catalog containing the entries describing the connected devices.

8.2.1. The Device Catalog

   Each Mesh Account has a Device Catalog CatalogDevice associated with
   it. The Device Catalog is used to manage the connection of devices to
   the Personal Mesh and has a CatalogEntryDevice for each device
   currently connected to the catalog.

   Each Administration Device MUST have access to an up-to-date copy of
   the Device Catalog in order to manage the devices connected to the
   Mesh. The Mesh Service protocol MAY be used to synchronize the Device
   Catalog between administration devices in the case that there is more
   than one administration device.

   The CatalogEntryDevice contains fields for the device profile, device
   private and device connection.

8.2.2. Mesh Devices

   The principle of radical distrust requires us to consider the
   possibility that a device might be compromised during manufacture.
   Once consequence of this possibility is that when an administration
   device connects a new device to a user's personal Mesh, we cannot put
   our full trust in either the device being connected or the
   administration device connecting it.





Hallam-Baker            Expires February 6, 2022               [Page 30]

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021

   This concern is resolved by (at minimum) combining keying material
   generated from both sources to create the keys to be used in the
   context of the user's personal Mesh with the process being fully
   verified by both parties.

   Additional keying material sources could be added if protection
   against the possibility of compromise at both devices was required
   but this is not supported by the current specifications.

   A device profile provides the axiom of trust and the key
   contributions of the device. When bound to an account, the base keys
   specified in the Device Profile are combined with the key data
   provided in the Activation device to construct the keys the device
   will use in the context of the account.

   Unless exceptional circumstances require, a device should not require
   more than one Device profile even if the device supports use by
   multiple users under different accounts. But a device MAY have
   multiple profiles if this approach is more convenient for
   implementation.

   The derivation of the Connection encryption and signature keys from
   the Profile and Private contributions in this example is shown in .

8.2.2.1. Creating a ProfileDevice

   Creating a ProfileDevice comprises the steps of:

         0) Creating the necessary key

         0) Signing the ProfileDevice using the Master Signature Key

         0) Once created, a ProfileDevice is never changed. In the
            unlikely event that any modification is required, a
            completely new ProfileDevice MUST be created.

8.2.2.2. Connection to a Personal Mesh

   Devices are only connected to a personal Mesh by an administration
   device. This comprises the steps of:

         0) Generating the PrivateDevice keys.

         0) Creating the ConnectionDevice data from the public
            components of the ProfileDevice and PrivateDevice keys and
            signing it using the administration key.

         0) Creating the Activations for the device and signing them
            using the administration key.

         0) Creating the CatalogEntryDevice for the device and adding it
            to the CatalogDevice of the Personal Mesh.

         0) If the Personal Mesh has accounts that are connected to a
            Mesh Service, synchronizing the CatalogEntryDevice to those
            services.

   These steps are usually performed through use of the Mesh Protocol
   Connection mechanism. However, Mesh clients MAY support additional
   mechanisms as circumstances require provided that the appropriate
   authentication and private key protection controls are provided.

8.3. Mesh Services

   A Mesh Service provides one or more Mesh Hosts that support Mesh
   Accounts through the Mesh Web Service Protocol.

   Mesh Services and Hosts are described by Service Profiles and Host
   Profiles. The means by which services manage the hosts through which
   they provide service is outside the scope of this document.

   As with a Device connected to a Mesh Account, a the binding of a Host
   to the service it supports is described by a connection record:

   The credentials provided by the ProfileService and ProfileHost are
   distinct from those provided by the WebPKI that typically services
   TLS requests. WebPKI credentials provide service introduction and
   authentication while a Mesh ProfileHost only provides authentication.

   Unless exceptional circumstances require, a service should not need
   to revise its Service Profile unless it is intended to change its
   identity. Service Profiles MAY be countersigned by Trusted Third
   Parties to establish accountability.

8.4. Mesh Messaging

   Mesh Messaging is an end-to-end secure messaging system used to
   exchange short (32KB) messages between Mesh devices and services. In
   cases where exchange of longer messages is required, Mesh Messaging
   MAY be used to provide a control plane to advise the intended message
   recipient(s) of the type of data being offered and the means of
   retrieval (e.g an EARL).

   All communications between Mesh accounts takes the form of a Mesh
   Message carried in a Dare Envelope. Mesh Messages are stored in two
   spools associated with the account, the SpoolOutbound and the
   SpoolInbound containing the messages sent and received respectively.

   This document only describes the representation of the messages
   within the message spool. The Mesh Service protocol by which the
   messages are exchanged between devices and services and between

                         Mesh Schema Reference               August 2021

   services is described in .

8.4.1. Message Status

   As previously described in section ###, every message stored in a
   spool has a specified state. The range of allowable states is defined
   by the message type. New message states MAY be defined for new
   message types as they are defined.

   By default, messages are appended to a spool in the Initial state,
   but a spool entry MAY specify any state that is valid for that
   message type.

   The state of a message is changed by appending a completion message
   to the spool as described in .

   Services MAY erase or redact messages in accordance with local site
   policy. Since messages are not removed from the spool on being marked
   deleted, they may be undeleted by marking them as read or unread.
   Marking a message deleted MAY make it more likely that the message
   will be removed if the sequence is subsequently purged.

8.4.2. Four Corner Model

   A four-corner messaging model is enforced. Mesh Services only accept
   outbound messages from devices connected to accounts that it
   services. Inbound messages are only accepted from other Mesh
   Services. This model enables access control at both the outbound and
   inbound services

   The outbound Mesh Service checks to see that the request to send a
   message does not violate its acceptable use policy. Accounts that
   make a large number of message requests that result in complaints
   SHOULD be subject to consequences ranging from restriction of the
   number and type of messages sent to suspending or terminating
   messaging privileges. Services that fail to implement appropriate
   controls are likely to be subject to sanctions from either their
   users or from other services.

   The inbound Mesh Service also checks to see that messages received
   are consistent with the service Acceptable Use Policy and the user's
   personal access control settings.

   Mesh Services that fail to police abuse by their account holders
   SHOULD be subject to consequences in the same fashion as account
   holders.

8.4.3. Traffic Analysis

   The Mesh Messaging protocol as currently specified provides only
   limited protection against traffic analysis attacks. The use of TLS
   to encrypt communication between Mesh Services limits the
   effectiveness of na?ve traffic analysis mechanisms but does not
   prevent timing attacks unless dummy traffic is introduced to
   obfuscate traffic flows.

   The limitation of the message size is in part intended to facilitate
   use of mechanisms capable of providing high levels of traffic
   analysis such as mixmaster and onion routing but the current Mesh
   Service Protocol does not provide support for such approaches and
   there are no immediate plans to do so.

9. Publications

   Static QR codes MAY be used to allow contact exchange or device
   connection. In either case, the QR code contains an EARL providing
   the means of locating, decrypting and authenticating the published
   data.

   The use of EARLs as a means of publishing encrypted data and the use
   of EARLs for location, decryption and authentication is discussed in
   .

9.1. Contact Exchange

   When used for contact exchange, the envelope payload is a
   CatalogedContact record.

   Besides allowing for exchange of contact information on a business
   card, a user might have their contact information printed on personal
   property to facilitate return of lost property.

9.2. Device Preconfiguration

   The static QR code device connection interaction allows a device with
   no keyboard, display or other user affordances to be connected to a
   Mesh account.

   The information necessary to establish communication with the device
   and to complete a device connection workflow is provided by means of
   a DevicePreconfiguration record accessed by means of an EARL.

   For example, Alice's coffee pot was preconfigured for connection to a
   Mesh account at the factory and the following DevicePreconfiguration
   record created:

   To connect to the coffee pot, Alice first scans the QR code with her
   administrative device which uses the PIN code and service to
   retrieve, decrypt and authenticate the DevicePreconfiguration record.
   Future versions of the specification will allow this record to
   specify means by which the administration device can establish direct
   peer-to-peer communication to complete the connection process by any
   communication modality supported by both devices (e.g. IR, Bluetooth,
   WiFi-Direct, etc.)

   The use of the publication mechanism in device connection is
   discussed further in .

9.3. Device Description

   The device description publication is a JSON Record that describes a
   device that is available for connection.
