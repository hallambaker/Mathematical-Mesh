<abstract>
<t>The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and credential data between multiple user devices. This document describes how Mesh profiles are stored for application access on Windows, Linux and OSX platforms.</t>
<t>This document is also available online at <eref target="http://prismproof.org/Documents/draft-hallambaker-mesh-platform.html"></eref>.</t>

<section title="Introduction" anchor="n-introduction"><t>This document describes recommended platform specific configuration for Mathematical Mesh applications. The use of common conventions for storage of profiles and private keys allows mesh enabled applications to interoperate on the same machine.</t>
<t>Protecting private key material from disclosure to other processes presents complex and difficult technical challenges. Ensuring that a key is properly erased from storage before memory is released relies on a complex series of assumptions about memory management at the compiler, operating system and the platform level. </t>
<t>For maximum security, the use of private key storage facilities provided by the platform is preferred.</t>

<section title="Container Locking" anchor="n-container-locking"><t>A combination of file access protections and system locks are used to prevent container data being corrupted through conflicting concurrent access.</t>
<ul>
<li>Since Dare Containers are append only, the scope for read/write conflict is limited to actions that cause the end of file marker to change. It is thus only necessary for processes to acquire a lock on the file when: </li>
<li>Reading the file to update the last position in the file.</li>
<li>Writing to the file to append an object.</li>
</ul>
<t>A single system-wide names MUTEX is used.</t>
<t>To write to the container, a process <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> acquire the named read MUTEX, performs the write operation and releases it. </t>
<t>A process reading the container <bcp14>SHOULD NOT</bcp14> acquire the container MUTEX to determine that the end of file marker is greater than zero or that the end of file marker has moved. A process <bcp14>MUST</bcp14> acquire the container MUTEX to update the value of the end of file marker so as to ensure that any pending write operation has completed.</t>
<t>The single lock approach was chosen in preference to more sophisticated approaches involving multiple concurrent read locks because the time to acquire the lock is typically greater than the time required to update the end of file position.</t>
