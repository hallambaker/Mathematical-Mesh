                       DNS Web Service Discovery             August 2021

1. Introduction

   Web services are traditionally identified by means of a URI
   specifying a Web Service Endpoint (WSE). This is approach is
   unsatisfactory in many situations:

         *  Specification of the Web Service requires the transport and
            presentation protocols to be fixed.

         *  The discovery mechanism does not provide support for load
            balancing or fault tolerance.

         *  The identifiers are unsuited for human interaction.

   The last consideration is a particular concern where an account
   identifier is exposed to the user. Attempts to 'teach' users to use
   URIs as account identifiers have been predictably unsuccessful. Users
   expect and require accounts to be of the form user@example.com and
   not http://service.example.com/service/user.

   The Web Service discovery process described in this specification
   builds on the approach specified in DNS-Based Service Discovery .
   This uses DNS SRV records as the basis for service discovery and TXT
   records as the basis for service description. This approach allows
   Web Services to make use of the load balancing and fault tolerance
   features of SRV and the service negotiation capabilities provided by
   the service description.

   One difficulty that is frequently encountered in attempting to make
   use of DNS records for service discovery is that it is not always
   possible for an application process to access this information.
   Specifications address the world as it actually is rather than as
   some believe it should be have proven more robust in real world
   deployment than those that do not. The discovery process defined
   includes a fallback strategy to enable clients to achieve Web Service
   discovery in these circumstances.

   Another difficulty that is encountered is that the SRV record maps
   service names to host names rather than Web Service Endpoints. A
   convention is thus required to map a host name and protocol prefix to
   a Web Service Endpoint. The HTTP Well Known Service  mechanism is
   used for this purpose.

   While the approach adopted in this specification closely follows that
   of , there is an important difference in that the earlier
   specification sets out a framework which Web Services may apply to
   develop a discovery approach that suits their particular needs while
   this specification defines exactly one such approach. In particular,
   the use of a common set of TXT keys to specify service parameters
   enables service discovery and negotiation to be delegated to common
   support libraries rather than being implemented independently in each

   application.

2. Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

2.2. Defined Terms

         Web Service

         Web Service Endpoint (WSE)

         Web Service Host

3. Service Discovery

   Service discovery is the process of resolving the address of a Web
   Service to a Web Service Endpoint, a URI  at which the service is
   provided.

3.1. Host Identification

   The first step in service discovery is to resolve the <domain> and
   <service> identifiers to the IP address of a host that provides that
   service.

3.1.1. SRV Host discovery

   A client attempting to connect to the service first attempts to
   locate an SRV record  for the specified service:

   _<service>._tcp.<domain>  SRV  <priority> <weight> <port> <host>

   Where <service> is the IANA assigned service name, <priority> and
   <weight> are the SRV priority and weight parameters specified in ,
   <port> is the TCP port number and <host> is the DNS name of the host
   for which the service advertisement is made.

   If no SRV records are found, the client MAY abort the connection or
   attempt use of the Fallback Discovery process described below.

                       DNS Web Service Discovery             August 2021

3.2. Service Description

   The second step in service discovery is to identify the attributes of
   the Web Service and Web Service Hosts providing that service.

3.2.1. TXT Service and Host Description

   A service MAY advertise service and/or host description information
   using TXT records as described in DNS-Based Service Discovery  .
   These have the following format:

   _<service>._tcp.<domain>  TXT "<key>=<value> [<tag>=<value>]*"
   _<service>._tcp.<host>  TXT "<key>=<value> [<tag>=<value>]*"

   Where <domain> and <host> are the domain names specified in the
   corresponding SRV records.

   Service descriptions specified under the domain address of the
   service apply to all host instances of the service. Descriptions
   specified under the domain address of a host instance apply only to
   that host instance and take precedence over values specified at the
   service level.

   The following keys are currently defined:

         path

         version

         encoding

3.3. Service Selection

   Web Service Hosts that do not meet the requirements of the client
   attempting to create a connection are eliminated before applying SRV
   service selection criteria specified in .

   Clients SHOULD limit the number of connections attempted before
   abandoning the attempt to connect.

3.4. Web Service Endpoint Determination

   Having selected a Web Service Host, the client determines the Web
   Service Endpoint as follows:

         *  If the description of the host specifies a path key, the
            corresponding value is used as the path, otherwise,

         *  if the description of the service specifies a path key, the
            corresponding value is used as the path, otherwise,

                       DNS Web Service Discovery             August 2021

         *  the path is /.well-known/srv/<service>

3.5. DNS Fallback

   Despite the fact that SRV records have been a part of the DNS
   standard for 20 years, it is not uncommon for network intermediaries
   to implement SRV record resolution incorrectly or block it entirely.
   If no SRV record is found, a client MAY perform fallback discovery if
   explicitly authorized to do so by the corresponding Web Service
   protocol specification.

   The Web Service Endpoint used is:

   https://<service>.<domain>/.well-known/srv/<service>

   Fallback discovery constrains the service provider to use a specific
   DNS configuration and provides inferior load balancing or fault
   tolerance capabilities to use of SRV records. It does however ensure
   that the service is reachable in situations where it would otherwise
   be unavailable.

3.6. Example

   The Mathematical Mesh has the Well-Known Service name of 'MMM'.
   Accounts used in the Mathematical Mesh follow the  format of
   <user>@<domain>.

   Alice has the account alice@example.com and the DNS configuration
   file for example.com has the following entries:

   _mmm._tcp.example.com SRV host1.example.com 0 10 80 host1.example.com
   _mmm._tcp.example.com SRV host2.example.com 0 40 80 host2.example.com
   _mmm._tcp.example.com TXT "version=1.0-2.0"
   mmm.example.com       CNAME host3.example.com
   host1.example.com     A 10.0.1.1
   host2.example.com     A 10.0.1.2
   _mmm._tcp.host2.example.com TXT "path=/service"
   host3.example.com     A 10.0.1.1
   host3.example.com     A 10.0.1.2

   The client attempts to resolve the address alice@example.com as
   follows:

         0) Client attempts to resolve SRV and TXT records for
            _mmm._tcp.example.com

         0) DNS resolver returns two SRV entries and one TXT entry

         0) Client makes a random selection between host1 (20%
            weighting) and host2 (80% weighting). Chooses host1.

         0) Client resolves A/AAAA for host1.example.com and TXT for
            _mmm._tcp.host1.example.com

         0) DNS resolver returns A=10.0.1.1 and TXT=none

         0) Client attempts to POST Web Service request to
            http://host1example.com/.well-known/srv/mmm at host address

         0) The host at 10.0.1.1 returns 503 Service Unavailable

         0) Client resolves A/AAAA for host2.example.com and TXT for
            _mmm._tcp.host2.example.com

         0) Request succeeds, session proceeds.

   If the same client is used in a network location where the SRV record
   resolution fails due to a faulty firewall configuration, the
   resolution proceeds as follows:

         0) Client attempts to resolve SRV record for
            _mmm._tcp.example.com

         0) DNS resolver returns 'not found'

         0) Client attempts to resolve A and AAAA record

         0) DNS resolver returns 10.0.1.1, 10.0.1.2

         0) Client makes a random selection between 10.0.1.1 (50%
            weighting) and 10.0.1.2 (50% weighting). Chooses host1.

         0) Client attempts to POST Web Service request to
            http://example.com/.well-known/srv/mmm at host address
            10.0.1.1

         0) The host at 10.0.1.1 returns 503 Service Unavailable

         0) Client attempts to POST Web Service request to
            http://example.com/.well-known/srv/mmm at host address
            10.0.1.2

         0) Request succeeds, session proceeds.

   Note that the main differences between these two scenarios is that
   the use of the SRV record allows the service configuration to account
   for load balancing with tiers of fallback support and use of service
   description information while the use of round robin A/AAAA records
   does not.

4. Further Work

4.1. Additional Description Keys

   The use of service and host descriptions to specify security
   enhancements is currently being considered. This provides a superset
   of the capabilities specified in .

         *  Specify minimum TLS version.

         *  Specify trust roots more flexibly

         *  Specify client authentication requirements

         *  Use of security enhancements other than TLS.

         *  Publish public keys to be used to protect negotiation of
            security enhancements

   The use of service and host descriptions to specify use of non-HTTP
   presentation transports is currently being considered.

4.2. Service Scaling

   This document considers the problem of establishing a connection to a
   Host providing a particular Web Service. When constructing services
   at very large scale (e.g. millions of concurrent users), it becomes
   desirable to enable discovery of a Web Service Host responsible for a
   particular partition of that data (e.g. a particular user account).

   Since this is clearly a different problem, it is judged that the best
   approach is to give it a different name and rule it out of scope of
   the present work.

5. Security Considerations

   A treatment of the security considerations will follow.
