Abstract

   A Threshold signature scheme is described. The signatures created are
   computationally indistinguishable from those produced using the
   Ed25519 and Ed448 curves as specified in RFC8032 except in that they
   are non-deterministic. Threshold signatures are a form of digital
   signature whose creation requires two or more parties to interact but
   does not disclose the number or identities of the parties involved.

1. Introduction

   Threshold encryption and key generation provide compelling advantages
   over single private key approaches because splitting the private key
   permits the use of that key to be divided between two or more roles.

   All existing digital signatures allow the signer role to be divided
   between multiple parties by attaching multiple signatures to the
   signed document. This approach, known as multi-signatures, is
   distinguished from a threshold signature scheme in that the identity
   and roles of the individual signers is exposed. In a threshold
   signature scheme, the creation of a single signature requires the
   participation of multiple signers and the signature itself does not
   reveal the means by which it was constructed.

   Rather than considering multi-signatures or threshold signatures to
   be inherently superior, it is more useful to regard both as two
   points on a continuum of choices:

         Multi-signatures

         Multi-party key release

         Threshold signatures

         Aggregate Signatures

   This document builds on the approach described in  to define a scheme
   that creates threshold signatures that are computationally
   indistinguishable from those produced according to the algorithm
   specified in . The scheme does not support the creation of aggregate
   signatures.

   The approach used is based on that developed in FROST . This document
   describes the signature scheme itself. The techniques used to
   generate keys are described separately in .

   As in the base document, we first describe signature generation for
   the case that n = t using 'direct' coefficients, that is the secret
   scalar is the sum of the secret shares. We then show how the scheme
   is modified using Shamir secret sharing  and Lagrange coefficients
   for the case that n > t.

1.1. Applications

   Threshold signatures have application in any situation where it is
   desired to have finer grain control of signing operations without
   this control structure being visible to external applications. It is
   of particular interest in situations where legacy applications do not
   support multi-signatures.

1.1.1. HSM Binding

   Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) prevent accidental disclosures of
   signature keys by binding private keys to a hardware device from
   which it cannot be extracted without substantial effort. This
   provides effective mitigation of the chief causes of key disclosure
   but requires the signer to rely on the trustworthiness of a device
   that represents a black box they have no means of auditing.

   Threshold signatures allow the signer to take advantage of the key
   binding control provided by an HSM without trusting it. The HSM only
   contributes one of the key shares used to create the signature. The
   other is provided by the application code (or possibly an additional
   HSM).

1.1.2. Code Signing

   Code signing is an important security control used to enable rapid
   detection of malware by demonstrating the source of authorized code
   distributions but places a critical reliance on the security of the
   signer's private key. Inadvertent disclosure of code signing keys is
   commonplace as they are typically stored in a form that allows them
   to be used in automatic build processes. Popular source code
   repositories are regularly scanned by attackers seeking to discover
   private signature keys and passwords embedded in scripts.

   Threshold signatures allow the code signing operation to be divided
   between a developer key and an HSM held locally or by a signature
   service. The threshold shares required to create the signature can be
   mapped onto the process roles and personnel responsible for
   authorizing code release. This last concern might be of particular
   advantage in open source projects where the concentration of control
   embodied in a single code signing key has proved to be difficult to
   reconcile with community principles.

1.1.3. Signing by Redundant Services

   Redundancy is as desirable for trusted services as for any other
   service. But in the case that multiple hosts are tasked with
   compiling a data set and signing the result, there is a risk of
   different hosts obtaining a different view of the data set due to
   timing or other concerns. This presents the risk of the hosts signing
   inconsistent views of the data set.

   Use of threshold signatures allows the criteria for agreeing on the
   data set to be signed to be mapped directly onto the requirement for
   creating a signature. So if there are three hosts and two must agree
   to create a signature, three signature shares are created and with a
   threshold of two.

2. Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in .

2.2. Defined Terms

   See  .

2.3. Related Specifications

   This document extends the approach described in   to support
   threshold signatures. The deterministic mechanism described in
   specification  is used to generate the private keys used in the test
   vectors.

2.4. Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document .

3. Principles

   The threshold signatures created according to the algorithms
   described in this document are compatible with but not identical to
   the signatures created according to the scheme described in . In
   particular:

         *  The signature verification algorithm is unchanged.

         *  The unanimous threshold scheme produces values of R and S
            that are deterministic but different from the values that
            would be obtained by using the aggregate private key to sign
            the same document.

         *  The deterministic quorate threshold scheme produces values
            of R and S that are deterministic for a given set of signers
            but will change for a different set of signers or if the
            aggregate private key was used to sign the same document.

         *  ?The non-deterministic quorate threshold scheme produces
            values of R and S that will be different each time the
            document is signed.

   Recall that a digital signature as specified by  consists of a pair
   of values S, R calculated as follows:

   R = r.B

   S = r + k.s mod L

         Where

   To verify the signature, the verifier checks that:

   S.B = R + k.A

   This equality must hold for a valid signature since:

         S.B

   The value r plays a critical role in the signature scheme as it
   serves to prevent disclosure of the secret scalar. If the value r is
   known, s can be calculated as s = (S-r).k^-1 mod L. It is therefore
   essential that the value r be unguessable.

   Furthermore, if the same value of r is used to sign two different
   documents, this results two signatures with the same value R and
   different values of k and S. Thus

   S_1 = r + k_1.s mod L

   S_2 = r + k_2.s mod L

   s = (S_1 - S_2)(k_1 - k_2)^-1 mod L

   The method of constructing r MUST ensure that it is unique and
   unguessable.

3.1. Direct shared threshold signature

   A threshold signature R, S is constructed by summing a set of
   signature contributions from two or more signers. For the case that
   the composite private key is the sum of the key shares (n = t), each
   signer i provides a contribution as follows:

   A_i = s_i.B

   R_i = r_i.B

   S_i = r_i + k.s_i mod L

   Where s_i and r_i are the secret scalar and unguessable value for the
   individual signer.

                Threshold Signatures in Elliptic Curves        July 2020

   The contributions of signers {1, 2, ... n} are then combined as
   follows:

   R = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n

   S = S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_n

   A = s.B

   Where s =  (s_1 + s_2 + ... + s_n) mod L

   The threshold signature is verified in the same manner as before:

   S.B = R + k.A

   Substituting for S.B we get:

   = (S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_n).B

   = S_1.B + S_2.B + ... + S_n.B

   = (r_1 + k.s_1).B + (r_2 + k.s_2).B + ... + (r_n + k.s_n).B

   = (r_1.B + k.s_1.B) + (r_2.B + k.s_2.B) + ... + (r_n.B + k.s_n.B)

   = (R1 + k.A1) + (R1 + k.A1) + ... + (Rn + k.An)

   Substituting for R + k.A we get:

   = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n + k.(A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n)

   = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n + k.A_1 + k.A_2 + ... + k.A_n

   = (R_1 + k.A_1) + (R_1 + k.A_1) + ... + (R_n + k.A_n)

   As expected, the operation of threshold signature makes use of the
   same approach as threshold key generation and threshold decryption as
   described in . As with threshold decryption it is not necessary for
   each key share holder to have a public key corresponding to their key
   share. All that is required is that the sum of the secret scalar
   values used in calculation of the signature modulo the group order be
   the value of the aggregate secret scalar corresponding to the
   aggregate secret key.

   While verification of  signatures is unchanged, the use of threshold
   signatures requires a different approach to signing. In particular,
   the fact that the value k is bound to the value R means that the
   participants in the threshold signature scheme must agree on the
   value R before the value k can be calculated. Since k is required to
   calculate the signature contributions S_i can be calculated, it is
   thus necessary to calculate the values R_i and S_i in separate

   phases. The process of using a threshold signature to sign a document
   thus has the following stages orchestrated by a dealer  as follows:

         0) The dealer determines the values F, C and PH(M) as specified
            in  and transmits them to the signers {1, 2, ... n}.

         0) Each signer generates a random value r_i such that 1  r_i
            L, calculates the value R_i = r_i.B and returns R to the
            dealer .

         0) The dealer calculates the value R = R_1 + R_2 + ... + R_n
            and transmits R and A to the signers {1, 2, ... n}.

         0) Each signer uses the suppled data to determine the value k
            and hence S_i = r_i + k.s_i mod L and transmits it to the
            dealer .

         0) The dealer calculates the value S = S_1 + S_2 + ... + S_n
            and verifies that the resulting signature R, S verifies
            according to the mechanism specified in . If the signature
            is correct, the dealer  publishes it. Otherwise, the dealer
            MAY identify the signer(s) that provided incorrect
            contributions by verifying the values R_i and S_i for each.

   For clarity, the dealer role is presented here as being implemented
   by a single party.

3.2. Shamir shared threshold signature

   To construct a threshold signature using shares created using Shamir
   Secret Sharing, each private key value s_i is multiplied by the
   Lagrange coefficient l_i corresponding to the set of shares used to
   construct the signature:

   A_i = s_il_i.B

   R_i = r_i.B

   S_i = ri + klisi mod L

   It is convenient to combine the derivation of S_i for the additive
   and Shamir shared threshold signatures by introducing a key
   multiplier coefficient c_i:

   S_i = ri + kcisi mod L

         Where

3.3. Stateless computation of final share

   One of the chief drawbacks to the algorithm described above is that
   it requires signers to perform two steps with state carried over from
   the first to the second to avoid reuse of the value r_i. This raises
   particular concern for implementations such as signature services or
   HSMs where maintaining state imposes a significant cost.

   Fortunately, it is possible to modify the algorithm so that the final
   signer does not need to maintain state between steps:

         0) All the signers except the final signer F generate their
            value r_i and submit the corresponding value R_i to the
            dealer

         0) Dealer calculates the value R - R_F and sends it to the
            final signer together with the all the other parameters
            required to calculate k and the  final signer's key
            multiplier coefficient c_F.

         0) The final signer generates its value r_F

         0) The final signer calculates the value R_F from which the
            values R and k can now be determined.

         0) The final signer calculates its key share contribution S_F =
            rF + kcFsF mod L.

         0) The final signer returns the values S_F and R to the dealer.

         0) The dealer reports the value R to the other signers and
            continues the signature process as before.

   While this approach to stateless computation of the signature
   contributions is limited to the final share, this is sufficient to
   cover the overwhelming majority of real-world applications where n =
   t = 2.

   Note that the final signer MAY calculate its value r_F
   deterministically provided that the parameters R - R_F and c_F are
   used in its determination. Other signers MUST NOT use a deterministic
   means of generating their value r_i since the information known to
   them at the time this parameter is generated is not sufficient to fix
   the value of R.

3.3.1. Side channel resistance

   The use of Kocher side channel resistance as described in  entails
   randomly splitting the private key into two shares and performing the
   private key operation separately on each share to avoid repeated
   operations using the same private key value at the cost of performing

   each operation twice.

   This additional overhead MAY be eliminated when threshold approaches
   are used by applying blinding factors whose sum is zero to each of
   the threshold shares.

   For example, if generation of the threshold signature is divided
   between an application program A and an HSM B using the final share
   approach to avoid maintaining state in the HSM, we might generate a
   blinding factor thus:

         0) A generates a random nonce n_A and sends it to B with the
            other parameters required to generate the signature.

         0) B generates a random nonce n_B

         0) B calculates the blinding factor x by calculating H(n_A, nB)
            where H is a strong cryptographic digest function and
            converting the result to an integer in the range 1  x  L.

         0) B calculates the signature parameters as before except that
            the threshold signature contribution is now S_B = rB +
            k(cBsB + x) mod L.

         0) B returns the nonce n_B to A with the other parameters.

         0) A calculates the blinding factor x using the same approach
            as B

         0) A calculates the signature parameters as before except that
            the threshold signature contribution is now S_A = rA +
            k(cAsA - x) mod L.

   This approach MAY be extended to the case that t > 2 by substituting
   a Key Derivation Function (e.g. ) for the digest function.

3.4. Security Analysis

   We consider a successful breach of the threshold signature scheme to
   be any attack that allows the attacker to create a valid signature
   for any message without the participation of the required threshold
   of signers.

   Potential breaches include:

         *  Disclosure of the signature key or signature key share.

         *  Modification of signature data relating to message M to
            allow creation of a signature for message M'.

         *  Ability of one of the signers to choose the value of the
            aggregate public key.

         *  Access control attacks inducing a signer to create a
            signature contribution that was not properly authenticated
            or authorized.

   We regard attacks on the access control channel to be out of scope
   for the threshold signature algorithm, though they are certainly a
   concern for any system in which a threshold signature algorithm is
   employed.

   We do not consider the ability of a signer to cause creation of an
   invalid signature to represent a breach.

3.4.1. Calculation of r values

   The method of constructing the values r_i MUST ensure that each is
   unique and unguessable both to external parties, the signers and the
   dealer. The deterministic method specified in  cannot be applied to
   generation of the values r_i as it allows the dealer to cause signers
   to reveal their key shares by requesting multiple signature
   contributions for the same message but with different values of k. In
   particular, requesting signature contributions for the same message:

   With different Lagrange coefficients.

   With a false value of R

   To avoid these attacks, the value r_i is generated using a secure
   random number generator. This approach requires the signer to ensure
   that values are never reused requiring that the signing API maintain
   state between the first and second rounds of the algorithm.

   While there are many approaches to deterministic generation of r_i
   that appear to be sound, closer inspection has demonstrated these to
   be vulnerable to rogue key and rogue contribution attacks.

3.4.2. Replay Attack

   The most serious concern in the implementation of any Schnorr type
   signature scheme is the need to ensure that the value r_i is never
   revealed to any other party and is never used to create signatures
   for two different values of k.s_i.

   Ensuring this does not occur imposes significant design constraints
   as creating a correct signature contribution requires that the signer
   use the same value of r_i to construct its value or R_i and S_i.

   For example, a HSM device may be required to perform multiple
   signature operations simultaneously. Since the storage capabilities
   of an HSM device are typically constrained, it is tempting to attempt
   to avoid the need to track the value of r_i within the device itself
   using an appropriately authenticated and encrypted opaque state
   token. Such mechanisms provide the HSM with the value of r_i but do
   not and cannot provide protection against a replay attack in which
   the same state token is presented with a request to sign different
   values of k.

3.4.3. Malicious Contribution Attack

   In a malicious contribution attack, one or more parties present a
   signature contribution that does not meet the criteria R_i = r_i.B
   and S_i = r_i + ks_i.

   Such an attack is not considered to be a breach as it merely causes
   the signature process to fail.

3.4.4. Rogue Key Attack

   A threshold signature scheme that allows the participants to 'bring
   their own key' may be vulnerable to a rogue key attack in which a
   signer is able to select the value of the aggregate public signature
   key by selecting a malicious public signature key value.

   The scheme described in this document is a threshold signature scheme
   and does not support this feature. Consequently, this attack is not
   relevant. It is described here for illustrative purposes only.

   This particular attack only applies when the individual signers
   create their own signature shares. It is not a concern when the
   signature shares are created by splitting a master signature private
   key.

   Consider the case where the aggregate public key signature is
   calculated from the sum of public signature key share values
   presented by the signers:

   A = A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n

   If the public key values are presented in turn, the last signer
   presenting their key share can force the selection of any value of A
   that they choose by selecting A_n = A_m -  (A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n-1)

   The attacker can thus gain control of the aggregate signature key by
   choosing A_m = s_m.B where s_m is a secret scalar known only to the
   attacker. But does so at the cost of not knowing the value s_n and so
   the signer cannot participate in the signature protocol.

                Threshold Signatures in Elliptic Curves        July 2020

   This attack allows the attacker and the attacker alone to create
   signatures which are validated under the aggregate signature key.

   The attack is a consequence of the mistaken assumption that a
   signature created under the signature key A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n
   provides evidence of the individual participation of the
   corresponding key holders without separate validation of the
   aggregate key.

   Enabling the use of threshold signature techniques by ad-hoc groups
   of signers using their existing signature keys as signature key
   shares presents serious technical challenges that are outside the
   scope of this specification.

7. Security Considerations

   All the security considerations of ,  and  apply and are hereby
   incorporated by reference.

7.1. Rogue Key attack

   The rogue key attack described in   is of particular concern to
   generation of threshold signatures.

   If A and B are public keys, the intrinsic degree of trust in the
   composite keypair A + B is that of the lesser of A and B.

7.2. Disclosure or reuse of the value r

   As in any Schnorr signature scheme, compromise of the value r results
   in compromise of the private key. The base signature specification
   describes a deterministic construction of r that ensures
   confidentiality and uniqueness for a given value of k.

   As described above, this approach is not applicable to the generation
   of values of r_i to compute threshold signature contributions.
   Accordingly the requirements of  regarding requirements for
   randomness MUST be observed.

   Implementations MUST NOT use a deterministic generation of the value
   r_i for any threshold contribution except for calculating the final
   contribution when all the other parameters required to calculate k
   are known.

7.3. Resource exhaustion attack

   Implementation of the general two stage signing algorithm requires
   that signers track generation and use of the values r_i to avoid
   reuse for different values of R_i. Implementations MUST ensure that

   exhaustion of this resource by one party does not cause other parties
   to be denied service.

7.4. Signature Uniqueness

   Signatures generated in strict conformance with  are guaranteed to be
   unique such that signing the same document with the same key will
   always result in the same signature value.

   The signature modes described in this document are computationally
   indistinguishable from those created in accordance with  but are not
   unique.

   Implementations MUST not use threshold signatures in applications
   where signature values are used in place of cryptographic digests as
   unique content identifiers.

8. IANA Considerations

   This document requires no IANA actions.
