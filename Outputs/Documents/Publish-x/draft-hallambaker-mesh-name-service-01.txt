                           Mesh Name Service              September 2020

1. Introduction

   The Mesh Name Service allows Mesh users to change Mesh Service
   Providers without the switching costs associated with usual naming
   schemes.

   The Mesh Name System is distinct from the DNS in several important
   respects:

         *  Mesh Names are intended to be the personal property of the
            assignee and use of the name MUST NOT require payment of
            ongoing rents, fees etc. of any kind.

         *  The DNS combines the functions of name delegation and
            discovery of services provided under those names into a
            single protocol. The MNS only supports name delegation.

   The limitation on scope allows MNS to provide all the functionality
   of a traditional DNS TLD with almost none of the costs. While the DNS
   functionality exposed by a DNS TLD is limited to information that
   changes very rarely (i.e. discovery of the IP addresses of the
   authoritative DNS servers), the protocol used to deliver that
   functionality is designed to support real time publication of service
   configurations.

   Another costly aspect of the DNS design is that there is no mechanism
   for invalidation of cached data. Instead every record has a
   predetermined expiry time and TLDs advise relying parties of updates
   to DNS records by publishing a new record. As a result, the vast bulk
   of (valid) TLD traffic consists of requests to check if the
   information has changed since the last time the party making the
   request checked. This approach makes the DNS infrastructure
   vulnerable to Denial of Service attack. If the DNS were ever to
   suffer a prolonged outage, the cached records would expire and the
   Internet would cease functioning.

   The MNS Name Registry is an append only log containing a complete
   history of every change made. Every registry update is authenticated
   by means of a Merkle Tree, the apex of which is signed once a minute.

   The Name Registry does not respond to name queries. Instead, every
   Mesh Service Provider is required to maintain a 'reasonably current'
   copy of the MNS Name Registry log and use this to respond to queries
   from the community it serves. This approach eliminates the almost all
   the costs associated with a DNS TLD registry and provides a 'fail
   safe' approach to design. Should the Name Service cease functioning
   for days or even weeks, only the ability to publish updates to
   existing configurations would be lost.

2. Definitions

   This section presents the related specifications and standard, the
   terms that are used as terms of art within the documents and the
   terms used as requirements language.

2.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in .

2.2. Defined Terms

2.3. Related Specifications

2.4. Implementation Status

   The implementation status of the reference code base is described in
   the companion document .

3. Architecture

3.1. Name Registry

   The name registry is implemented as a Mesh Catalog.

3.1.1. Name Entries

   A name entry consists of the following information:

         Name

         Profile Identifier

         Assignment Type

         Mesh Service Provider

         DNS Resolver Addresses (Optional)

         Bindings (Optional)

3.2. Name syntax

   A Mesh name consists of a sequence of Unicode characters.

   To prevent homograph type attacks, only characters from selected
   Unicode alphabet are permitted and mixing of characters from
   different alphabet s is prohibited with the exception of special
   characters that are permitted in any name.

   The only special characters currently permitted are the digits 0-9,
   underscore (_) and dash(-).

   The only alphabet currently supported is Extended Latin.

   Canonicalization rules are applied within an alphabet to avoid
   ambiguity. For the Extended Latin alphabet, canonicalization causes
   case to be ignored, and ligatures to be mapped according to the
   prevailing rules applied in circumstances where accented characters
   are unavailable.

3.3. Name Assignment

   The first time a name is assigned, the assignment type is 'Initial'.

4. Business Model

4.1. Names do not expire
