Alice encrypts the text file plaintext.txt to create an encrypted version
readable only by Alice:


Alice can recover the file at any time using the decryption command:


Although the encrypted file can be accessed by Alice with precisely the same ease as the plaintext

Alice explicitly grants access. The encrypted file may be stored on a shared drive, cloud file system
or removable storage without disclosing the contents.
