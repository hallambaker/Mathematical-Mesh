Alice encrypts the text file plaintext.txt to create an encrypted version
readable only by Alice:


~~~~
<div="terminal">
<cmd>Alice> meshman type plaintext.txt
<rsp>This is a test
<cmd>Alice> meshman dare encode plaintext.txt ciphertext.dare /encrypt ^
    alice@example.com 
<cmd>Alice> meshman dare verify ciphertext.dare
<rsp>File: ciphertext.dare
    Bytes: 16
    Encryption Algorithm: A256CBC
        Recipient: MDRQ-D4T6-ZXL2-BVBU-V3TG-RB5A-ERMA
    Digest Algorithm: S512
    Payload Digest: E5138679E155B7595869C4597AA1134F9163137FF29903032
273657D07B98B3C75827BD7E60128671305FEB42FD85BAF7576C9700A9A671C8E924D
28C00AB288
</div>
~~~~

Alice can recover the file at any time using the decryption command:


~~~~
<div="terminal">
<cmd>Alice> meshman dare decode ciphertext.dare plaintext1.txt
<cmd>Alice> meshman type plaintext1.txt
<rsp>This is a test
</div>
~~~~

Although the encrypted file can be accessed by Alice with precisely the same ease as the plaintext
version, the contents of the encrypted file are not readable by any other user of the machine unless 
Alice explicitly grants access. The encrypted file may be stored on a shared drive, cloud file system
or removable storage without disclosing the contents.
