Alice creates the recryption group groupw@example.com to share confidential information with
her closest friends:


Bob encrypts a test file but he can't decrypt it because he isn't in the group:


Even though she is the group administrator, Alice can't decrypt the file either until
she adds herself to the group.


Alice adds Bob to the group:


Adding Bob to the group gives him immediate access to any file encrypted under
the group key without making any change to the encrypted files:


Removing Bob from the group immediately withdraws his access.


Bob cannot decrypt any more files (but he may have kept copies of files he decrypted 
earlier).
