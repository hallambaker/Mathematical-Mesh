# Mathematical Mesh 

The Mesh is an infrastructure that makes the Internet easier to use by
making it more secure.

Bad security design doesn't just create insecurity, it causes endless user 
headaches. Traditional Internet security applications are hard to use because
little to no thought was given to usability in their design.

Carl Ellison's law states that the user base for any application is halved for
every mouse click or keystroke that is required of them. My personal experience
suggest that this likely understates the problem.

The Mesh is designed to provide users with the highest level of security that
is possible without asking them to do anything at all. For this to become 
possible, the Mesh will have to be shipped to users as part of the machine 
Operating System.

## Mathematical Mesh Reference Library

The Reference Library is an Open Source (MIT License) library implementing
the Mesh protocols and encodings. It is also the source from which the 
reference sections of the Mesh specifications are generated and the code
used to generate all the examples.

The reference library has three main goals:

* To serve as a vehicle for documenting and developing the Mesh specifications.

* To be used in applications to enable use of Mesh capabilities

* To serve as a benchmark against which the standards compliance of other
implementations may be tested.

## Meshman Shell Tool

meshman is a shell tool that exposes most Mesh functionality in
a form that is compatible with most scripting environments.

Detailed [documentation](https://github.com/hallambaker/Mathematical-Mesh/tree/master/Web) of meshman is given in the 
User Guide and Reference Manual:
