###hallambaker-json-web-service

Need to provide examples for use of authentication and encryption using mesh profile
keys.

###Key Exchange Service

New service to provide 'first contact' services. These include key exchange and protocol

for unauthanticated requests - anyone can see the policy. This is for cases where the
policy itself is protected.
