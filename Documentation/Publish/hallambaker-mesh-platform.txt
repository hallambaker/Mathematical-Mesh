               Mathematical Mesh: Platform Configuration
                   draft-hallambaker-mesh-platform-00

Abstract

   The Mathematical Mesh 'The Mesh' is an end-to-end secure 
   infrastructure that facilitates the exchange of configuration and 
   credential data between multiple user devices. This document 
   describes how Mesh profiles are stored for application access on 
   Windows, Linux and OSX platforms.

1. Definitions

1.1. Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2. Configuration Scope

3. Windows Platform Configuration

   The Windows Configuration is stored in a combination of Windows Key 
   Store entries, registry entries and data files.

   The profiles that are available to a user are specified as Windows 
   registry keys.

   Cached and archival copies of profiles are stored on the local 
   machine as data files with file names and locations specified in the 
   Windows registry.

   Cryptographic keys are stored in a Windows key store.

   To locate a device, application or personal profile, an application:

   Searches for a Windows registry entry that matches the relevant 
   criteria.

   Retrieves the profile data from either a local cached copy or the 
   corresponding portal.

   Accesses the corresponding private keys through the Windows key 
   store.

   The Windows Key store is the natural storage location for 
   cryptographic keys on the Windows platform as keys are at minimum 
   protected by the operating system access control mechanism. The 
   Windows key store also permits the use of cryptographic hardware 
   devices.

3.1. Registry Key Entries

   All keys used by the Mathematical Mesh are stored in the following 
   Windows registry location:

Internet-Draft  Mathematical Mesh Platform Configuration  September 2016

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\CryptoMesh

   This location has the following sub keys:

         PersonalProfiles
            (Default) -> UDF fingerprint of the default personal profile

         PersonalProfiles\<UDF>
            (Default) -> File location for the profile.

            Archive -> File location for the profile archive.

            Portals -> Multistring containing portal accounts to which 
            the profile is registered. The default portal is first.

         ApplicationProfiles
            Web -> UDF fingerprint of default Web Application profile

            SSH -> UDF fingerprint of default SSH Application profile

            Network -> UDF fingerprint of default network Application 
            profile

            Mail -> UDF fingerprint of default Mail Application profile

            UDF Fingerprint of profile -> File location of profile 

         DeviceProfiles
            (Default) -> UDF fingerprint of default device profile

            UDF Fingerprint of Device profile -> File location of device
            profile

3.4. Profiles

3.4.1. Locating a personal profile

   To locate the default personal profile, an application:

   Retrieves the key PersonalProfiles\(Default) to get <UDF>

   Locates the profile with identifier <UDF>

   To locate the personal profile with identifier UDF, an application:

   Retrieves the key PersonalProfiles\<UDF>

   Retrieves the latest version of the profile from the location 
   specified in PersonalProfiles\<UDF>\(Default)

   If necessary, the profile is refreshed from one of the accounts 
   specified in PersonalProfiles\<UDF>\Portal

   In case of an inconsistency being detected, the application MAY use 
   the archived copies of the profile to resynchronize.

   Note that having been connected to a profile at some time in the past
   does not guarantee that a device currently has access, even if the 
   device in question was an administration device for the profile.

3.4.2. Locating a device profile

   To locate a device profile an application 

3.4.3. Locating an application profile

   To locate a device profile an application 

4. OSX Platform Configuration

   The OSX configuration is stored in a combination of a master 
   configuration file, profile data files and the OSX KeyChain

   The profiles that are available to a user are stored in a JSON 
   configuration file 

   Cached and archival copies of profiles are stored on the local 
   machine as data files with file names and locations specified in the 
   JSON configuration file

Internet-Draft  Mathematical Mesh Platform Configuration  September 2016

   Cryptographic keys are stored in the OSX Key Chain.

   File locations

   The JSON Configuration file is stored in ~/.cryptomesh/profiles.json

   Profile data files are stored in a directory ~/.cryptomesh/<UDF>

   The latest copy of the profile is stored in <UDF>.mmm

   An archive containing all the stored profiles is stored in 
   <UDF>.all.mmm

4.1. Key Storage

   Private keys are stored in the OSX Key Manager in some fashion to be 
   decided later.

5. Linux Platform Configuration

   The Linux configuration is stored in a combination of a master 
   configuration file, profile data files and private key files.

   The file layout of the Linux configuration and data files is 
   identical to that of OSX.

5.1. Key Storage

   Private Keys are stored in the locations that the Linux applications 
   that are to use them expect to find them.

6. JSON configuration File

7. Application Programming Interface

7.1. C# 

   The C# reference code base provides the following classes to provide 
   access to the Mesh machine configuration:
